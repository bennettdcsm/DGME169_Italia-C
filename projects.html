  <section class="project-detail" id="project1">
    <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
    <p><strong>Course / Context:</strong> DGME 169. CSS Grid Assignment.</p>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> The purpose for this assignemnt was getting familar with CSS Grids and web standards. I was trying to accomplish a good starting point.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Example: Dreamweaver, Modules, HTML/CSS, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Process:</strong> My first approach was getting to know the language which was difficult. After that I tried coding for the first time with no previous experience. I saw immediatly it wasnt going to be easy. After that I realized that I shoudl research more on just now to use dreamweaver.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> My final result was definitely beginner friendly but it was indeed a starter point.I slowly started to get to get familiar with dreamweaver, which allows me to create these sites.</p>

    <h2>Layout Assignment</h2>
    <p><strong>Course / Context:</strong> DGME 169 Flex Box Layout Assignment.</p>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Hands-on intro to CSS Flexbox. The goal was to build responsive layouts that can adjust to different size screens.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Dreamweaver, HTML, CSS (focus on Flexbox properties).</p>
    <p><strong>Process:</strong> It was difficult remembering how each flexbox responds. As I practiced then items eventually looked even on safari or chrome (How they should) I ultimately experienced with changing values and watching how they moved on the page.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The final layout was simple but how I figured it would be and it was functional so thats all I could ask for. This is where I gained understanding on how websites are managed on different screens.</p>

    <h2>FUN Thanksgiving website</h2>
    <p><strong>Course / Context:</strong> DGME 169 CSS Aesthetics Assignment.</p>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> This project was fun which I think I was missing while also needed knowing what I do now with the help of my past projects. My goal was to make my best website yet with the mindset of making it fun and useful with interesting facts and data.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Dreamweaver, HTML, CSS.</p>
    <p><strong>Process:</strong> I started by choosing my color pallete and images for what I wanted to include in the website. Then getting into it I alligned the text and spacing. After that I added those pictures into my folder which then added them to my project which is what really made it. Under the photos I added known tradtions of thanksgiving that gave it some depth..</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> With knowing what I do it was fun adding it onto a website that wasnt so serious. Somewhere I can add them all together while looking forward to the holidays.</p>
